###~~~Memory and Foraging Agent Based Model Version 3~~~###
#The goal of this agent based model is to allow flexible and efficient exploration of the impact of spatial memory an animal foraging.
#It will allow for manipulation of memory size, accuracy, and properties such as learning or forgetting rules.
#The model will incorporate aspects of optiomal foraging theory into the animal behavior, and additional allow for different
#navigational decision strategies. The model will then measure overall foraging efficiency given the different memory and
#navigation properties.
